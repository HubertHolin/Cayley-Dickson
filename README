This python library implements the Cayley-Dickson doubling process
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayleyâ€“Dickson_construction), as well as
congruence rings. For the later, it borrows heavily upon work by Jeremy Kun
(https://jeremykun.com/2014/02/08/introducing-elliptic-curves/,
https://github.com/j2kun/elliptic-curve-signature).

This library is in support of my research in Number Theory
(arXiv:math/0506349 [math.RA]), with a view towards applications to Cryptography
(DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.24952.55040).

It is pretty much a work in progress, though basic functionality is present.
Facilities for exploring Caley-Galois constructs are planed.

This library requires at least Python 3.5, in order for the __matmul__ operator
to be present (though we hijack its usual meaning).
